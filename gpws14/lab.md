### Connecting to the Internet

If you have eduroam access please use it. Otherwise if you don't have
eduroam, try the guest account.

To connect with the guest account use network ID `guest` and the WEP key
`63a0b34855`.

### Preinstalled GPy

If you have IPython and GPy installed on your machine you need to first
start by typing

      ipython notebook

into a terminal window (or the command window on Windows).
Then start a new notebook and cut and paste the following commands for
the relvant lab class.

#### Lab 1

      import urllib
      urllib.urlretrieve('http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpws14/lab1.ipynb', 'lab1.ipynb')

#### Lab 2

      import urllib
      urllib.urlretrieve('http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpws14/lab2.ipynb', 'lab2.ipynb')

#### Lab 3

      import urllib
      urllib.urlretrieve('http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpws14/lab3.ipynb', 'lab3.ipynb')

If you return to the original notebook screen and you should see that
the relevant lab is now available. Click on it and start the lab.

### No Installed IPython or GPy

For attendees without IPython installed on their notebooks we are
providing local servers for log in. You need to get a slip of paper from
one of the organizers which will provide a link and a port name. You
will be asked for a password, it is `gpws2014` and it *should* get
access to the servers. Don't use the lab files that are on the servers
(just delete the files that are on there), instead follow the
instructions above to download the latest version of the lab.
